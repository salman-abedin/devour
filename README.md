# Devour: Window Manager agnostic swallowing feature for terminal emulators

Devour hides your terminal window before launching an external program and unhides it after quitting.  
Devour was inspired by
[sw](https://github.com/ronniedroid/.dotfiles/blob/master/Scripts/sw)
and is a successor to
[devour.sh](https://github.com/salman-abedin/devour.sh)

## Pro Tip

**Devour from your file explorer instead of the shell.**  
Watch my demo and notice how seamless it is compared to devouring from the shell.  
**Hint:** If you are one of those unfortunate souls who uses **xdg-open** instead of
[a custom launch script](https://gist.github.com/salman-abedin/6f52c52e465d89d489f9ea8d891c7332),
then go to your **~/.local/share/applications** directory and modify the applications you launch from your file explorer like below and enjoy the true devouring experience.

```
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=PDF Reader
